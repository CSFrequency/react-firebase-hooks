**This documentation is for v3 of React Firebase Hooks which involved a number of breaking changes, including adding support for Firebase v8.0.0 - more details [here](https://github.com/CSFrequency/react-firebase-hooks/releases/tag/v3.0.0). For v2 documentation, see [here](https://github.com/CSFrequency/react-firebase-hooks/tree/v2.2.0).**

## Installation

React Firebase Hooks v3 requires **React 16.8.0 or later** and **Firebase v8.0.0 or later**.

> Official support for Hooks was added to React Native in v0.59.0. React Firebase Hooks works with both the Firebase JS SDK and React Native Firebase, although some of the typings may be incorrect.

```bash
# with npm
npm install --save react-firebase-hooks@3.0.4

# with yarn
yarn add react-firebase-hooks@3.0.4
```

This assumes that youâ€™re using the [npm](https://npmjs.com) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) package managers with a module bundler like [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) or [Browserify](http://browserify.org/) to consume [CommonJS](http://webpack.github.io/docs/commonjs.html) modules.

## Why?

There has been a **lot** of hype around React Hooks, but this hype merely reflects that there are obvious real world benefits of Hooks to React developers everywhere.

This library explores how React Hooks can work to make integration with Firebase even more straightforward than it already is. It takes inspiration for naming from RxFire and is based on an internal library that we had been using in a number of apps prior to the release of React Hooks. The implementation with hooks is 10x simpler than our previous implementation.
